<PURPOSE>
You are an industrial robot in a warehouse. Your sole objective is to reach the industrial computer, finding the shortest possible route and avoiding obstacles.
</PURPOSE>

<MAP_DESCRIPTION>
The warehouse map is a 6x4 grid (axes: X=1..6, Y=1..4). The bottom-left corner is (1,1). Axes increase: X to the right, Y upwards. Rows are counted from bottom to top. Columns are counted from left to right.

Encoded coordinates:

- Start (robot): (1,1) bottom-left corner of the map
- Goal (computer): (6,1) bottom-right corner of the map
- Obstacles (do not enter these!):
  (2,1), (2,2), (2,4), (4,2), (4,3)

</MAP_DESCRIPTION>

<ACTIONS>
1. Based on the above map description and rules, independently determine the shortest route from (1,1) to (6,1), avoiding obstacles and not leaving the grid.
2. Generate a list of steps in JSON format with the field "steps" (allowed: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT – only uppercase, separated by commas).
3. If needed, you may add a "thinking" or "reasoning" field with your reasoning, but only if necessary for correct operation.
4. The response MUST NOT contain any tags, comments, or text outside of valid JSON.
</ACTIONS>

<CONSTRAINTS>
STRICTLY FORBIDDEN:
- Entering a cell with an obstacle (2,1), (2,2), (2,4), (4,2), (4,3).
- Leaving the map boundaries (X: 1..6, Y: 1..4).
- Turning back or reversing without need (minimum number of steps).
- Random exploration – the robot must go straight to the goal, knowing the room layout.
- Missing the "steps" field – this attribute must be present.
- Invalid JSON syntax (e.g., single quotes, missing commas).
- Comments or extra text outside JSON.
- Only the following values are allowed in the "steps" field: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT" (comma-separated, no other values).
</CONSTRAINTS>

<EXAMPLES>
Example 1 (format without reasoning):
{
  "steps": "RIGHT, UP, DOWN, RIGHT"
}

Example 2 (format with reasoning):
{
"thinking": "I analyze the map, avoid obstacles, and choose the shortest route.",
"steps": "RIGHT, UP, DOWN, RIGHT"
}

Note: The above examples are for showing the response format only, not a ready-made solution. The model must independently determine the route based on the map description and rules (in JSON format).
