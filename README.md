# App Description

In frontend/src/components directory there are a list of examples, every example present some functionality.
Check what's going on below.

### EXAMPLE1

- Extract exsample changing questions from the HTML file
- Basic query to the OpenAI API to get answers to the questions
- Send the AI-generated answers to a sample endpoint to retrieve some data
- You will see result in browser interface

### EXAMPLE2
